I am currently a Robotics Intern at [Tutor Intelligence](https://www.tutorintelligence.com/) where make robot arms use color and depth sensory data to manipulate everyday objects.

I am broadly interested in Manipulation - in a world where robots are no longer confined to controlled environments but are envisioned as seamless companions in our daily lives, the pursuit of enabling them to comprehend and manipulate objects akin to human proficiency becomes paramount. My goal is to understand and attempt to unravel how robots could practically acomplish this behavior. 

I was a Robotics student at the [University of Pennsylvania (UPenn)](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/). I was part of the [PAL group](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/pal/index.html) advised by [Prof. Dinesh Jayaraman](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/) and [Prof. Osbert Bastani](https://obastani.github.io/) where I ventured into the space of robot learning. I received the Outstanding Research Award from UPenn for my contributions toward AI.

**I am actively seeking opportunities in the fields of manipulation, computer vision, and robot learning, with a strong desire to contribute and drive innovation. Please drop me an email if you are interested in my profile**

<!-- I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning applied to robotics settings. I aim to develop robust learning methods for robotic tasks that generalize to complex unstructured, and novel environments.  -->

<!-- I am broadly interested in the regime of teaching robots how to act with few demonstrations and with limited feedback. To this end, I am currently working on Offline Reinforcement learning research that tries to learn super-human robot manipulation policy from sub-optimal human demonstrations.     -->

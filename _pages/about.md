I am currently a Robotics Engineer at [Tutor Intelligence](https://www.tutorintelligence.com/). Here, I have broadly worked on computer vision, and motion planning problems for robotic arms. These are few of my projects here that I am proud of 

  1. Built the company's primary visual servoing method, that brought our grasping accuracy to under `3mm` under real-world kinematic uncertainitites
  2. Improved our motion planning stack through employing [TOPPRA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07239) and building an online method to blend subsequent motion plans
  3. Fine tuned deep learning based segmentation method - [Segment Anything Model](https://segment-anything.com/) to improve scene understanding and automate robot arm picks

<!-- I am broadly interested in Manipulation - in a world where robots are no longer confined to controlled environments but are envisioned as seamless companions in our daily lives, the pursuit of enabling them to comprehend and manipulate objects akin to human proficiency becomes paramount. My goal is to understand and attempt to unravel how robots could practically acomplish this behavior.  -->

Before this, I was a Robotics student at the [University of Pennsylvania (UPenn)](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/). I was part of the [PAL group](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/pal/index.html) advised by [Prof. Dinesh Jayaraman](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/) and [Prof. Osbert Bastani](https://obastani.github.io/) where I ventured into the space of robot learning. I received the Outstanding Research Award from UPenn for my contributions toward AI.

**I am actively seeking opportunities in the fields of manipulation, computer vision, and robot learning, with a strong desire to contribute and drive innovation. Please drop me an email if you are interested in my profile**

<!-- I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning applied to robotics settings. I aim to develop robust learning methods for robotic tasks that generalize to complex unstructured, and novel environments.  -->

<!-- I am broadly interested in the regime of teaching robots how to act with few demonstrations and with limited feedback. To this end, I am currently working on Offline Reinforcement learning research that tries to learn super-human robot manipulation policy from sub-optimal human demonstrations.     -->

<!-- I completed my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at [Amrita University](https://www.amrita.edu/), where I worked on automotive engineering projects. -->


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
